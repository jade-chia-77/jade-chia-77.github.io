    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p>Currently the R&D Commercialisation Lead at NewFish, Jade brings years of experience and cross-functional expertise to the NewFish team. Young, energetic and progressive, her insatiable ambition and drive to challenge tradition and integrate growing technologies motivates her to lead industry change by example; an interesting talent to watch. She is here to visibly disrupt, encourage and facilitate meaningful, engaging conversations to create innovative solutions.
      A food technologist by trade, her FMCG background spans across marketing, strategy and value-creation, sales, technical applications (taste modulation, alternative proteins, dairy, nutraceuticals, baked goods and fermented foods). A well-rounded foundation across business functions highlights her ability to easily adapt to dynamic environments. Jadeâ€™s natural and rapid ability to learn, connect, communicate and lead, provides the NewFish Team with foresight and counsel in value chain strategy and propositions, in a highly dynamic industry.
      Jade's fundamental belief and calling is to lead and shape the global food biotechnology sector, to minimise the detrimental environmental, social and economic effects of intensified food production and manufacturing. There is a need and opportunity to integrate increasing (bio)technological advancements into both current and emerging foodstuffs, ingredients and sub-industries. The NewFish team truly believes Jade is here to lead the future of innovation and ingenuity.</p>
