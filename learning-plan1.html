      <h1>Learning Plan ü§ì</h1>
      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>My mission is to create innovative solutions within the agritech and biotech space, preferably within Primary Industries or food manufacturing. I truly believe software and technology are the future, I love working in the FMCG and food manufacturing sector, but see there are so many missed opportunities. This agritech solution is designed to provide farmers with alternative solutions in IP generation, which they can then leverage as part of their offerings, back to the big corporates. There isn‚Äôt a linear pathway for this succession; I‚Äôm out here to forge my own.
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning. I am a strong, independent and self motivated learner; this is not my first time studying. This was a strategic decision to study again! A limitation is time as I am working  full-time, and am currently undertaking 3 other courses on top of this! Many hobbies, one might say. GCal is my favourite tool.</p>
      <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>To learn to communicate with intent and clarity. I tend to over communicate to provide context.</p>
      <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
        <h3>This should include:
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives.
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
      <p>I find that I am very schedule-oriented. If it‚Äôs not in my calendar, I won‚Äôt do it! I spend 5 minutes at the beginning of each day planning my objectives and priorities, and reflecting on whether I achieved my goals from the day beforehand, if not, why? What could I have done better? If there is something I‚Äôm stuck on, I know the Discord chat is there with my cohort (I‚Äôve already made some friends) or access the help desk online. I‚Äôm also keen to meet some of the other cohort members for a drink so we can have regular meetups to work on our projects together! After hours, my friend who recommended I attend DevAcademy went through the course and currently works in IT. He is happy to help me too.
        I don‚Äôt tend to let things fester and build up, I like to tackle the problem when it is manageable. If I‚Äôve tried something 4 times, I‚Äôll go for a walk, come back, tackle it again, and if I have trouble, I‚Äôll immediately reach out. I‚Äôm not stressed about workload ‚Äì I work for a startup, which has taught me how to prioritise and manage me time. My minimum at the moment is to dedicate 10 hours a week (2 hours / weekday) to taking my time and making my way through each Sprint.</p>
      <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
     <p>See above</p>
     <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
     <p>To be available during work hours to help facilitate and troubleshoot any needs or requests. Discord works well because it‚Äôs easy enough to live chat. Also some feedback on my work after each module would be good, but I anticipate this will come after the foundations course. No expectation beyond that!</p> 
     <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2> 
     <p>I‚Äôve got three other courses I am attending:
      Chinese (Mandarin) Lessons ‚Äì Monday Evenings
      Pottery Classes ‚Äì Thursday Evenings
      Women in Executive Leadership - Escalator 2023 ‚Äì Ongoing
      My current dedicated learning time is afterwork, but on the days I have the commitments above, I will dedicate my allocated 2 hours of learning time in the morning before work üôÇ</p>
