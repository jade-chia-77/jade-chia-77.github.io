        <h1>Margin, Border, and Padding in HTML and CSS</h1><br>
        <div class="table">
          <div class="box">
            <h3>What is Margin?</h3>
              <p>In HTML and CSS, the margin refers to the space around an element, creating a gap between the element and its neighboring elements. It defines the area outside the element's border.<br>
              The margin property allows you to control the amount of space between an element and other elements in its surroundings. By adjusting the margin values, you can increase or decrease the distance between the element and its adjacent elements.<br>
              The margin can be set individually for each side (top, right, bottom, and left) or in shorthand notation for all sides simultaneously. Positive margin values push the element away from neighboring elements, creating space, while negative margin values can bring elements closer together, potentially overlapping them.<br>
              The margin property is commonly used in CSS to create spacing between elements, control layout, and provide visual separation. It plays a crucial role in achieving proper alignment and spacing within a web page's design.

          <div class="box">
            <h3>What is Padding?</h3>
              <p>In HTML and CSS, padding refers to the space between the content of an element and its border. It defines the area inside the element's border.<br>
              The padding property allows you to control the amount of space between the content of an element and its edges. By adjusting the padding values, you can increase or decrease the space within the element.<br>
              Padding can be set individually for each side (top, right, bottom, and left) or in shorthand notation for all sides simultaneously. Positive padding values increase the space between the content and the border, providing breathing room, while negative padding values reduce the space, potentially causing the content to overlap the border.<br>
              Padding is commonly used in CSS to create spacing and improve the readability and aesthetics of an element. It helps to visually separate the content from the edges of the element, ensuring proper alignment and spacing within the overall layout of a web page.
              </p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <h3>What is Border?</h3>
              <p>In HTML and CSS, a border refers to a visible line or boundary that surrounds an element. It is used to define and highlight the edges of an element. The border property allows you to control the appearance of the border around an element. You can specify its thickness, style, and color.
                <ul>
                  <li>Thickness: You can set the width or thickness of the border, typically measured in pixels, using the border-width property.
                  </li>
                  <li>Style: You can choose from different styles for the border, such as solid, dashed, dotted, double, and more, using the border-style property.
                  </li>
                  <li>Color: You can define the color of the border using the border-color property. It can be specified by using named colors, RGB values, hexadecimal codes, or other color formats.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Borders can be applied individually for each side (top, right, bottom, and left) or in shorthand notation for all sides simultaneously. Additionally, CSS provides the border-radius property to create rounded corners for the border.
                Borders are commonly used in CSS to visually separate and define the boundaries of elements. They help to give structure and emphasis to various elements on a web page, such as images, buttons, containers, and more. Borders can be customized to match the overall design and enhance the visual appeal of the web page.

        <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2><br>
        <p>Margin, padding, and border are fundamental concepts in HTML and CSS that define the spacing and visual presentation of elements.<br>
          Here's a simple description of their differences:
          <ul>
            <li>Margin: Margins refer to the space around an element, creating a gap between the element and its neighboring elements. It defines the area outside the element's border. Margins provide spacing between elements and control the distance between an element and its surroundings.
            </li>          
            <li>Padding: Padding refers to the space between the content of an element and its border. It defines the area inside the element's border. Padding provides space within an element and separates the content from the edges. It affects the spacing between the content and the border of an element.
            </li>
            <li>Border: Borders are visible lines or boundaries that surround an element. They define the edges of an element. Borders can have a specific thickness, style, and color, and they visually separate and highlight the boundaries of an element. Borders contribute to the overall structure and visual presentation of elements.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
        <p>
          Margin controls the space outside an element, creating gaps between elements. Padding controls the space inside an element, separating the content from the edges. Border defines the visible line or boundary surrounding an element, highlighting its edges.<br>
          By adjusting margin, padding, and border properties, you can achieve proper spacing, alignment, and visual separation within your HTML and CSS layouts.
