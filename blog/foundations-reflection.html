            <h2>Three new things I have learnt about myself and ego from the core learning?</h2>
            <p>I've found that I get very self-competitive. I like to push myself. I know where my boundaries are, but I like to push myself and see if I can exceed those expectations, which often leads to a bit of burnout.
              My ego is my biggest strength and downfall at the same time, it's all about context! Interestingly enough, throughout, I've also noticed that I am more confident in myself than what can be realistic sometimes -
               I am very easily distracted, and lose track of time, then think I can make up the lost time. This is to my own detriment. It ends up with me setting myself up for failure! I also need to slow down, and take the
                time to let the information sink in, before rushing ahead and trying to solve every challenge possible!</p>

            <h2>The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming</h2>
            <p>For me, the empathy is the compassion, vulnerability and trust you have in yourself and others when presented with a challenge. It is what drives an understanding of how certain functions or ways of coding may 
              impact others, and how or why, they think differently to yourself. This is especially relevant in peer programming projects! Self-awareness is the ability to focus on yourself, your actions and understand the impact
              of their consequences. In programming, this is again, especially important when you're interacting with others, i.e. whether this be a customer, colleague or peer programmer. It's also helpful and important when it
              comes to continuous growth and self improvement. The same could be said about your code - being able to reflect and assess what you could have done better. Values are the fundmental building blocks in shaping how we
              see the world and interact with the world and others around us. Values steer our behaviours; in understanding value, we can understand the way different people may perceive things, which informs application functionality,
              and empathy when it comes to understanding others.

            <h2>The most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>The most challenging aspect of core learning was the motivation to push myself to put my 100% into it. I feel like I've done a lot of core learning in other programmes and professional development courses, but forcing 
              myself to do so, has encouraged good habits and self reflection. This has bee instrumental to my learning style when it comes to coding! The world around us is dynamic and as a result, so are we. Learning new skills or 
              facts about ourselves can only be to our own advantage. This is the mindset I've had to adopt through foundations to keep myself motivated to finish the core activities.

            <h2>What surprised me the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>In reference to the answer above, it's that despite doing similar core learning exercises in my personal and professional lives, I've discovered and learned something completely new about myself in doing so. That's the 
              most surprising part. The interesting thing is, that it's really helped me identify what my core strengths and weaknesses are!

            <h2>Why do I think DevAcademy, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course</h2>
            <p>There is a certain stereotype people have about programmers, and it's not a positive one! DevAcademy strives to break this stereotype, and foster inclusion and diversity within the programming industry, through encouraging 
              individualism. In addition to this, DevAcademy prides itself on giving students the right tools and skills for success in the industry, this is one way to do this and set themselves apart from other programming providers.

            <h2>Does the time I've spent studying core learning eel like a waste of time? Should I have used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
            <p>This feels like an essay I'm writing for credits haha. No, absolutely not. As alluded to earlier, I feel I have learnt a lot about myself and my learning style, but taking the time to focus on my core skills. It's highlighted 
              my areas or weaknesses and strengths, which I can play to and improve, to make myself a better programmer. It's also encouraged me to approach situations and complex problems in a differnet way; I don't think like a programmer, 
              so this is learning an entirely new language and skill for me! I'm happy I spent the time reflecting and working on my core skills, at the end of the day, it has only benefitted me. In future, when I finally become a professional 
              programmer, these core skills will help set me apart from other programmers (re: sterotypes), and destroy them in the interview process. Here to set myself up for success ðŸ’ƒ
