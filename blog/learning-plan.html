      <h1>Learning Plan ðŸ¤“</h1>
      <div class = "box">
        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>My mission is to create innovative solutions within the agritech and biotech space, preferably within Primary Industries or food manufacturing. I truly believe software and technology are the future, I love working in the FMCG and food manufacturing sector, but see there are so many missed opportunities. This agritech solution is designed to provide farmers with alternative solutions in IP generation, which they can then leverage as part of their offerings, back to the big corporates. There isnâ€™t a linear pathway for this succession; Iâ€™m out here to forge my own.
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning. I am a strong, independent and self motivated learner; this is not my first time studying. This was a strategic decision to study again! A limitation is time as I am working  full-time, and am currently undertaking 3 other courses on top of this! Many hobbies, one might say. GCal is my favourite tool.
        </p>
        <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          <p>To learn to communicate with intent and clarity. I tend to over communicate to provide context.
          </p>
        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
        <p>I find that I am very schedule-oriented. If itâ€™s not in my calendar, I wonâ€™t do it! I spend 5 minutes at the beginning of each day planning my objectives and priorities, and reflecting on whether I achieved my goals from the day beforehand, if not, why? What could I have done better? If there is something Iâ€™m stuck on, I know the Discord chat is there with my cohort (Iâ€™ve already made some friends) or access the help desk online. Iâ€™m also keen to meet some of the other cohort members for a drink so we can have regular meetups to work on our projects together! After hours, my friend who recommended I attend DevAcademy went through the course and currently works in IT. He is happy to help me too.
          I donâ€™t tend to let things fester and build up, I like to tackle the problem when it is manageable. If Iâ€™ve tried something 4 times, Iâ€™ll go for a walk, come back, tackle it again, and if I have trouble, Iâ€™ll immediately reach out. Iâ€™m not stressed about workload â€“ I work for a startup, which has taught me how to prioritise and manage me time. My minimum at the moment is to dedicate 10 hours a week (2 hours / weekday) to taking my time and making my way through each Sprint.

        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
          <p>See above, last answer</p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
          <p>To be available during work hours to help facilitate and troubleshoot any needs or requests. Discord works well because itâ€™s easy enough to live chat. Also some feedback on my work after each module would be good, but I anticipate this will come after the foundations course. No expectation beyond that!</p> 
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2> 
          <p>Iâ€™ve got three other courses I am attending:
            Chinese (Mandarin) Lessons â€“ Monday Evenings
            Pottery Classes â€“ Thursday Evenings
            Women in Executive Leadership - Escalator 2023 â€“ Ongoing
            My current dedicated learning time is afterwork, but on the days I have the commitments above, I will dedicate my allocated 2 hours of learning time in the morning before work ðŸ™‚
          </p>

        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>My career pathway is to use this skill to start a software company focused on biotech or agritech. That is the way of the future. My background is in food science and engineering, so this is the perfect addition to my skillset!
        </p>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>My biggest strength will be my determination to finish the course. As for my limitation, I think it's Javascript. I've been feeling pretty nervous about this...</p>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
        <p>I think my biggest limitation will be internet access and time, during the first 3 weeks, as I'll be overseas.</p>
        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>Probably better leadership and strategy, the ability to think ahead and create workstreams that enable that. In programming, it's probably code that can be refactored!</p>
        <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
        <p>Well, initially I was feeling quite okay with bootcamp, given that the time allocated seemed accurate, but now a bit nervous, knowing there is no suggested timeframes... Am feeling unsure about the workload given I've found adjusting to bootcamp difficult in the beginning</p>
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>To probably just ask for help when I need it.... I have a feeling I'm going to find bootcamp really difficult!</p>
