            <h2>That Time I was Block By A Simple Problem</h2>
            <h5>What was the problem?</h5>
            <p>I had just spent a few hours in this "follow along" exercise, where I could code at the same time as the video tutorial. All was well, I was following along as per the video, and when I was checking my progress, it seemed my page had some functional issues!</p>
            <p><br>I HAD FOLLOWED ALL THE STEPS OF THE TUTORIAL!</p>
            <h5>Problem-solving techniques used?</h5>
            <p>Actually reading the error messages that pop up in both VS Code and as I was using console.log! These are absolute game changers. Coders who designed all of these interfaces are so incredibly smart and forward thinking!</p>
            <h5>How I felt throughout the process</h5>
            <p>Frustrated to say the least, when I was troubleshooting, but this very quickly changed to embarrassment once I figured out the problem, and almost turned into annoyance.</p>
            <h5>Learnings</h5>
            <p>Always check the spelling of your code. Everything is in American Enlgish, so be careful. VS Code is fantastic for picking up issues - check the "red" underlined words or elements to quickly troubleshoot any problems that may arise later on. It's also a great idea to continually commit and push your files in progress, so you can revert to a previous version if you need to!</p>

            <h2>That time I elegantly solved a problem!</h2>
            <h5>What was the problem?</h5>
            <p>Sometimes in these challenges, I feel really overwhelmed by the challenges, and don't know where to start, particularly when it comes to loops, a concept I don't feel I'm strongest in. This just starts a cycle of demotivated procrastination!</p>
            <h5>Problem-solving techniques used?</h5>
            <p>I've started takign a deep breath, and breaking down the challenge into sentences, working my way through each one. Techniques I've found particularly helpful are the "Rubber Ducky" method and "Pseudocode". I tend to use a combination of the two. Breaking down the problem into approachable sections (pseudocode), then explaining the reasons behind each step in its simplest form.</p>
            <h5>How I felt throughout the process</h5>
            <p>Incredibly overwhelmed and doomed! Well, initially anyway. Once I've overcome this, I feel like I'm on top of the world and can accomplish anything! It's empowering.</p>
            <h5>Learnings</h5>
            <p>I've discovered that if you can descrive and explain a concept, you must really understand it - a sort of verbal processing if you will. This helps me consolidate ideas and concepts. In addition to this, I've started writing notes in my files for the approach I would take, to remind myself of what the next steps are to solving each problem, so I can give my full attention to each section.</p>

            <h2>My confidence using the following problem solving techniques</h2>
            <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
            <p>As described above, this is fast becomming a favourite method of mine. I'm quickly turning this into a habit as I write notes in my coding files to really highlight the thought process behind approaching problems. This could be helpful to others who may need to access my files too.</p>
            <h5>Trying something</h5>
            <p>As a new-age millennial, this is my specialty. I love change in all aspects of my life and profession. If the change doesn't out-perform the original, you can always revert back to what you were doing before!</p>
            <h5>Rubber ducky method</h5>
            <p>I wasn't aware of this method until this sprint. I found this pretty helpful as I'm a verbal processor, and explaining concepts (as I would) to others helps me consolidate concepts</p>
            <h5>Reading error messages</h5>
            <p>Similar to console.logging, I wasn't the biggest fan, but now that I understand the language more, I tend to read the error messages because I can understand them</p>
            <h5>Console.logging</h5>
            <p>Initially, I wasn't the biggest fan, but now I appreciate console.logging because it gives you feedback in real-time, which I anticipate is something that I will appreciate more and more as thisn course progresses</p>
            <h5>Googling</h5>
            <p>Big fan! This is essentially my go-to-method for problem solving. We live in an age where information has never been so accessible. There are generally more than one way to approach a problem, and some might make more sense than others.</p>
            <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5>
            <p>I've made some good connections through this course, which makes asking for help easy. They are very welcomming and always available. Not my preferred method as I'd prefer to problem solve myself in the first instance</p>
            <h5>Asking coaches for help</h5>
            <p>Again, Lani and John are very approachable, which makes asking them for help very easy</p>
            <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5>
            <p>I often think this is a good process, but at the same time, you don't know what you don't know, and sometimes there may be better methods or ways to approach a problem, which you're not aware of. I find the home groups a really good place to address these, and always come away feeling like I've gained a new perspective. It's only then I can go away and think about how I can approach similar problems in a new way, and whether this would have any benefits</p>

            <h2>A Time I was Reluctant to Ask For Help</h2>
            <p>Typically, I like to try and solve a problem myself without asking for help, so I can learn from the process. One time I felt a bit silly asking for help was when I was having issues in a blog post, my HTML file wasn't pulling the formatting from my CSS. I spent a few hours trying to figure out what was wrong with the file path. Another HTML file that was pulling from the same CSS file seemed to work, so why didn't this one? The problem seemed so simple!</p>
            <p><br>TLDR, I ended up wasting a lot of time because I was too embarrassed to ask for help on a simple problem. Eventually, I sucked up my ego and asked the coaches for help, and within a few minutes, they found the bug and the problem was fixed. What a waste of time I will never get back! Moral of the story, don't waste more than 1 hour on a problem without asking the coaches. They are there to help you, and are there to create a safe space without judgement to do so!</p>
