              <h2> JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h2><br>
                <p>The easiest way to udnerstand the relationship is using an analogy or through a story.<br>
                  Imagine a web page as a house. HTML is the structure and layout of the house, determining where each room and furniture goes.<br>
                  CSS is like the interior design, adding colors, styles, and decorations to make the house visually appealing.<br>
                  JavaScript, on the other hand, is like the electricity and plumbing system that brings life to the house. It provides interactivity, enables dynamic content, and allows you to control and manipulate the elements within the HTML and CSS.</p>
