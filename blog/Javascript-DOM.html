                <h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
                <p>I'm a foodie at heart, not a programmer. What is this nonsense about Javascript, HTML and CSS you ask? Think of it as a recipe!</p>

                  <p>HTML is like the list of ingredients in a recipe. It defines the structure and basic elements of a web page, just like how the ingredient list outlines what you need to make a dish. HTML provides the foundation and specifies what elements (like headings, paragraphs, buttons, etc.) are present on the page.<br><br>
                  CSS is like the seasoning and presentation of a dish. It adds flavor and style to the recipe, just like how CSS adds colors, layouts, fonts, and other visual styles to HTML elements. CSS makes the web page visually appealing and enhances its presentation.<br><br>
                  JavaScript is like the cooking instructions in a recipe. It provides the interactivity and functionality to the web page, just like how cooking instructions guide you through the steps of preparing a dish. JavaScript allows you to add dynamic behavior, perform calculations, handle events, and manipulate HTML and CSS elements on the web page.<br><br>

                <h3>Confused by Loops and Control Flow?</h3>
                <p>Let's continue on the foodie theme. Think about the breakfast you had this morning, arguably, the most important meal of the day!<br><br>
                  In this example, let's think about pancakes. Control flow can be thought of as the order of the steps taken to make the panackes. <br>
                  For example, gathering the ingredients, measuring them out, making the batter and cooking the batter.<br><br>
                  Loops can be thought of as repeating actions until a certain condition is met. In this example, that would be stirring the batter until it becomes smooth or flipping pancakes until they are cooked on both sides.

                </div>
                  <p> We can also describe the pancake example in this diagram above. The input, controller and controlled process are the pancake recipe, aka "the control flow". The entire process including the output are the "loop". The entire process is repeated until the desired outcome is achieved, in this case, once we have enough pancakes!

              <h3>What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?</h3>
              <p>The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure, where each element in the document is represented as a node in the tree. The DOM allows programmers to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page using scripting languages like JavaScript.</p>
