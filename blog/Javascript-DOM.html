                <h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
                <p>I'm a foodie at heart, not a programmer. What is this nonsense about Javascript, HTML and CSS you ask? Think of it as a recipe!</p>

                  <p>HTML defines the structure and elements of a web page like a recipe's ingredient list. CSS adds style and presentation, like seasoning a dish. JavaScript provides interactivity and functionality, guiding actions on the web page, similar to cooking instructions in a recipe.<br><br>

                <h3>Confused by Loops and Control Flow?</h3>
                <p>Let's continue on the foodie theme. Think about the breakfast you had this morning, arguably, the most important meal of the day!<br><br>
                  In this example, let's think about pancakes. Control flow can be thought of as the order of the steps taken to make the panackes. <br>
                  For example, gathering the ingredients, measuring them out, making the batter and cooking the batter.<br><br>
                  Loops can be thought of as repeating actions until a certain condition is met. In this example, that would be stirring the batter until it becomes smooth or flipping pancakes until they are cooked on both sides.

                </div>
                  <p> We can also describe the pancake example in this diagram above. The input, controller and controlled process are the pancake recipe, aka "the control flow". The entire process including the output are the "loop". The entire process is repeated until the desired outcome is achieved, in this case, once we have enough pancakes!

              <h3>What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?</h3>
              <p>The DOM is a programming interface that represents the structure and content of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure. It allows programmers to interact with and modify the elements, attributes, and text content of a web page using scripting languages like JavaScript. In simple terms, the DOM enables dynamic manipulation of web pages, such as changing text, modifying styles, adding or removing elements, and responding to user interactions.</p><br><br>
