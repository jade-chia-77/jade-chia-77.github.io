      <h1>Values ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è?</h1>
      <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
        <p>When I was about 8 years old, I had a pet rabbit. His name was Eros, and he was a beautiful, timid and demure Holland Loped Eared bunny. Unfortunately, as he grew older, he became more incontinent, wasn't eating and developed cataracts.
          It was a difficult decision to make; whether to put him down or to prolong his suffering. Ultimately, we didn't have the capacity to provide him with the care he needed, so he was euthanised.
          At the time, I felt morally conflicted, but when I think about the decision now, I feel it was the right decision. He was high needs and an elder bunny, even if he was rehomed, he would not have sustained the incontenence and eating habits.</p>
        <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <p>Fundamentally, I come from an Singaporean family; we're open to change, but prefer to intertwine our traditional roots. It's been a bit of a struggle with learning more about my culture; I have not family outside of my parents and brother, and they aren't exactly traditional!
          When I am in New Zealand I feel like I don't belong because I am different, but when I go to Singapore, it's the same feeling. There's a feeling of not belonging. Rather than focusing on my identity crisis haha, my parents have always struggled with financial stability.
          Not having the means to join a sports team or buy new clothes when I was younger has shaped my incredible work ethic and high threshold for workload.
          Now that I am older and I have the freedom to make decisions of my own, I never want to be in a position they were in - struggling to put food on the table.

        <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
        <p>
          Top strengths
          * Futuristic - strategic with the ability to understand the big picture and the total impact of smaller actions
          * Achiever - perfectionist, a tendency to go above and beyond requirements
          * Learner - to continually engage in gaining new knowledge and skills, driving me to learn beyond the requirements. Learning out of interest!
          * Individualisation - the ability to read and play into the strengths of others, to create strong connections. They may be able to help me when I'm stuck!
          * Responsibility - motivation to successfully achieve and take accountability for required tasks - very helpful in group projects!

        <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
        <p>The only limitation I can think of is allocated time! Lucky I'm a strict GCal user and this is my prioritisation tool!</p>
        <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
        <p>Sometimes people can be reactive in big meetings, whether that is subconscious or consciously - there's a lot at play i.e how they are perceived.
          I often find it helpful to talk with people one on one to understand their motivations, what their expected outcomes are, and what role they would like to play in the process.
        Normally people already know the story they want to hear, it's a matter of rephrasing and encouraging this in a way that is meaningful for them and one that works for everyone else.
      I've found this approach very helpful in my professional life as a project manager.</p>
